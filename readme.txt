# Sequence-to-video
This script allows you to create a .mp4 video output based on your sequence images.

This video shows you how it works: https://vimeo.com/443237195
You need ffmpeg installed: https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/


Copy the .bat file into the folder of your sequence and then run it.


If you wanna add the option to your right click menu, just edit the .reg file and change the path of where you store the .bat file.
